# Skate-Shop-Backend
# Overview

This started a couple years ago when I was just starting out making websites, I built this for a friend. In the end it did not function and was all in plain html with no backend. This project was to finish or at least see how I have improved in Full stack devolopment by 3/18/23.

This is an e-commerce wite that sells skateboards and stakeboard accesories. It uses the MERN stack, except I used NestJS instead of Express because I liked how it looks and feels more organized.

I wrote this to test how foar I have progressed.

# Web Pages

Home: The home page is where you land and shows a breif overview and gives a customer a taste of what they can get.

Search: This doubled as a catagory display screen, and shows the user a filtered assortment of the available products.

# Development Environment

I developed this in VSCode and run it on my Localhost

I programmed this useing a modification of the MERN stack, (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS), except I used NestJS instead of Express, because I have slightly more experience in it.
